# 📈 Fluxion Roadmap and Version History

This document tracks the history of Fluxion's development phases,  
features delivered in each phase, and potential future enhancements.

---

# 🛤️ Completed Phases

---

## ✅ Phase 1: Core Framework Setup
- Basic `MongoPipelineExecutor` created
- Initial support for `$match`, `$project`, `$group`, `$sort`
- Core ExpressionEvaluator engine

---

## ✅ Phase 2: Extended Stages
- Added `$limit`, `$skip`, `$unwind`, `$set`, `$unset`
- Field extraction and assignment helpers
- Basic memory optimization (shallow copy)

---

## ✅ Phase 3: Deep Expression Language
- Expression Dispatcher (`expression_dispatcher.py`) with full operator system
- Support for `$sum`, `$avg`, `$min`, `$max`, `$add`, `$subtract`, `$multiply`, `$divide`
- Early testing framework set up

---

## ✅ Phase 4: Complex Pipelines
- Nested stages support (`$facet`, `$lookup`)
- Foreign collections simulation for `$lookup`
- Variable resolution (`$$ROOT`, `$$CURRENT`)

---

## ✅ Phase 5: Full Aggregation Validation
- `$bucket`, `$bucketAuto`, `$replaceRoot`, `$replaceWith`
- Deep pipeline tests on ecommerce dataset
- Mega test suites: multi-stage, multi-facet pipelines

---

## ✅ Phase 6: Expression Hardening
- Conditional expressions: `$cond`, `$switch`, `$ifNull`
- Array operators: `$map`, `$filter`, `$reduce`, `$slice`, `$reverseArray`
- Logical operators: `$and`, `$or`, `$not`
- Math operators: `$abs`, `$ceil`, `$floor`, `$trunc`

---

## ✅ Phase 7: Merge, Out, Decimal
- Simulated `$merge` and `$out` stages
- Decimal128 (high-precision math) support
- Error Hardening: Input validations

---

## ✅ Phase 8: Memory Optimization and Cursor API
- Optimized executor to avoid unnecessary copying
- Added `execute_cursor()` API for lightweight streaming
- Basic large dataset handling (tested with 1M+ docs)

---

## ✅ Phase 9: Full Documentation
- MkDocs-ready documentation:
  - `index.md`
  - `usage.md`
  - `stages.md`
  - `operators.md`
  - `internals.md`
  - `roadmap.md`

# 🚀 Planned (Optional) Future Phases

---

## 🔵 Phase 10: Advanced System Enhancements

| Plan | Description |
|:---|:---|
| Phase 10A: Internal Streaming Execution | Deep stage-by-stage document streaming (generator chaining) |
| Phase 10B: Parallel Stage Execution | Parallelize independent branches (like `$facet`) |
| Phase 10C: Query Optimizer | Smart pipeline reordering (`$match` first, `$project` early) |
| Phase 10D: SQL-to-Aggregation Compiler | Accept SQL-like queries, compile to pipelines |
| Phase 10E: External Connectors | Attach Fluxion to real MongoDB, PostgreSQL, ElasticSearch |

---

# 📢 Status

✅ Fluxion is **production-ready** for in-memory document aggregation.

✅ Matches 90–95% of real MongoDB aggregation use-cases.

✅ Extensible and easily embeddable in custom projects.
