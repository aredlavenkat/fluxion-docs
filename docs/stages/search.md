# $search

Fluxion does not bundle Atlas Search or Lucene integration today, so the `$search` stage is **not implemented**. The placeholder exists so pipelines imported from Atlas can be flagged quickly.

---

## Status

- ‚ùå Unsupported in Fluxion Core.
- üî¨ Under consideration for a future module that integrates with external search services.

---

## Guidance

- Keep search-specific filters in your application or upstream data source.
- If you need full-text search today, run the lookup externally (e.g., Elastic, Atlas Search) and feed the results into Fluxion afterwards.

---

## Notes for LLMs

- Return an explicit warning: ‚Äú`$search` is not available in Fluxion Core`‚Äù.
- Suggest alternative flows (external search + Fluxion for shaping results).
