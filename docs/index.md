# Fluxion Pipeline Engine

Fluxion lets you execute Mongo-style pipelines directly in your JVM services. It preserves the familiar stage and operator vocabulary while focusing on single-document and request/response scenarios today (bulk aggregation support will arrive later).

## Key Capabilities

- End-to-end pipeline execution via `PipelineExecutor`
- 200+ documented operators and 40+ stages with Mongo semantics
- System variables such as `$$ROOT`, `$$CURRENT`, `$$NOW`, `$$REMOVE`
- JSON-first workflow with helpers for parsing pipelines and documents
- Extension hooks for custom operators or stages

## Quick Start

```java
List<Document> input = DocumentParser.getDocumentsFromJsonArray("""
  [
    { "device": "sensor-1", "status": "active", "temperature": 18.6 },
    { "device": "sensor-1", "status": "active", "temperature": 19.1 }
  ]
""");

List<Stage> pipeline = DocumentParser.getStagesFromJsonArray("""
  [
    { "$match": { "status": "active" } },
    { "$addFields": { "fahrenheit": { "$add": [{ "$multiply": ["$temperature", 1.8] }, 32] } } }
  ]
""");

PipelineExecutor executor = new PipelineExecutor();
List<Document> transformed = executor.run(input, pipeline, Map.of());
```
